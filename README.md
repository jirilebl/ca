Guide to Cultivating Complex Analysis: Working the Complex Field
----------------------------------------------------------------

One-semester graduate level mathematics textbook on basic complex analysis in
one variable.  Written for the graduate complex analysis course (5283) at
Oklahoma State University.  There is a bit more than a one-semester's worth of
material in there to allow some choices.  If the metric space appendix is also
covered first, then it is quite a bit more than one-semester's worth.

* ca.tex is the LaTeX file
* notations.tex is the list of notations
* Figures are in figures/
* publish.sh compiles the file to pdf (probably overdoing it, but that doesn't hurt)
* getstats.sh counts the numbers of sections, exercises, figures, etc.
* resizepdftocrownquatro.sh resizes a pdf to Crown Quatro size (which is what a printed version, once there is one, will be using)
