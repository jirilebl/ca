Guide to Cultivating Complex Analysis: Indoctrination in One Variable
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note:** Work in progress.  It is still being written; I am actively 
updating it as I'm teaching out of it.  It is not finished even
to the end of the semester yet.  The plan is to be complete (complete
though perhaps not finished) at least for a semester-long course by
the end of this semester (spring 2020), as by that time all in that
course will have to have been covered.

One-semester graduate level mathematics textbook on basic complex analysis in
one variable.  Written for the graduate complex analysis course (5283) at
at Oklahoma State University.

* ca.tex is the LaTeX file
* notations.tex is the list of notations
* Figures are in figures/
* publish.sh compiles the file to pdf (probably overdoing it, but that doesn't hurt)
* getstats.sh counts the numbers of sections, exercises, figures, etc.
* resizepdftocrownquatro.sh resizes a pdf to Crown Quatro size (which is what a printed version, once there is one, will be using)
