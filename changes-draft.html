<li>Note that the first example functions in 6.1.1 are all bounded,
	oddly this changes pagination on the following pages
	very slightly to be nicer.
<li>Consistently use
"converges uniformly on compact subsets" instead of sometimes
"converges uniformly on compact sets."
<li>In proof of Riemann mapping, at the end refer back to the construction of
  the \(h\) to make it clear why the maximizer must be onto.
<li>Add Exercise 6.3.9 (entire and injective implies onto)
<li>In proof of Lemma 6.3.6, use \(m\) instead of \(n\) in the start of the
  proof for the number of discs to avoid overuse of \(n .\)
<li>Change the proof of 7.1.10 (Identity) to be more consistent with
  7.1.11 (Maximum principle).
