<li>On page 18, improve figure 1.4 to include a shaded horizontal and
  vertical strip in two shades of gray to make it easier to see.
<li>At end of section 1.3, when discussing arithmetic, note that
  $z+\infty=\infty$ can be defined, it is just that $\infty+\infty$
  and $\infty-\infty$ are undefined.
<li>In section 1.4, when defining $T_a$ and $D_a$ note where $a$ lives,
  in particular, that for $D_a,$ the $a$ should be nonzero.
<li>On page 54 when comparing the definitions of line integrals, fix the
  right hand side and also add an underbrace that shows that the right hand
  side is precisely our previous definition.
<li>After the definition of the line integral, note that the definition still
  holds even if the derivative would be zero.
<li>Fix Proposition 3.1.7 to mention that the new path might not be a path if
  we are disallowing zero derivatives.
<li>In the remark after Definition 3.2.5 emphasize "is" and "is equivalent to"
  to make it clear what is the difference that we are talking about.
<li>In proof of 3.2.9 make sure to state that $\alpha$ is a complex number.
<li>Add Exercise 6.2.10, which is a nice application of Montel to
  characterizing the radius of convergence.
<li>Add Exercise 7.3.11 that requires infinitely many reflections.
<li>Flip the order of proof in Proposition A.2.13 to be more logical.
<li>In Exercise A.3.11, only ask for the part of the proposition that was not
  yet proved to avoid confusing matters.
<li>Theorem A.5.7 should mention that $X$ ought not be empty.
<li>Clean up the proof of Proposition B.2.1 to not use sequences as it's
  simpler without.
<li>Some minor clarifications and fixes throughout.
<li>Fix the known <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
