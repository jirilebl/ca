<li>In the proof of Proposition 3.5.3, use b instead of a in the proof,
  as it is not quite the a from the statement.
<li>In the proof of Theorem 4.7.3, make the lines be horizontal to avoid
  a rotation midway through the argument.  Modify Figure 4.10
  to match this new setup.  It is true it makes the first part
  a little weird as it's not the graph $y=f(x)$ but $x=f(y)$ now, but I think
  it is now clearer and matches the picture in all parts of the proof.
<li>In section 9.4, try to use letters as indices only for
  specific purpose, to make things clearer.
  In particular, use \(m\) for the index in the expression
  \(P_p,\) in the statement of the theorem, and use 
  \(p\) for the point in Example 9.4.2
  and in the statement of Exercise 9.4.1.
<li>Add Example 9.4.3 with the example from Exercise 9.4.2, showing that the
  \(R_n\) really are necessary in general.
<li>Add a note after proof of the Monodromy theorem on page 229
  about all paths fixed-endpoint homotopic in a simply
  connected domain, and add an exercise (10.2.17)
  to prove the converse (actually prove existence of primitives)
  as it is a nice quick application of
  continuation.
