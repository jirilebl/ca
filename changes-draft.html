<li>On page 18, improve figure 1.4 to include a shaded horizontal and
  vertical strip in two shades of gray to make it easier to see.
<li>Also on page 18, use \(w\) for the target variable to avoid confusion
  when defining the annulus and the sector.
<li>At end of section 1.3, when discussing arithmetic, note that
  \(z+\infty=\infty\) can be defined, it is just that \(\infty+\infty\)
  and \(\infty-\infty\) are undefined.
<li>In section 1.4, when defining \(T_a\) and \(D_a\) note where \(a\) lives,
  in particular, that for \(D_a,\) the \(a\) should be nonzero.
<li>In section 2.1.1 emphasize a tiny bit more the fact that the \(h\)
  is complex.
<li>In section 2.1.1 explicitly state what \(o(|h|)\) means rather than being
  vague.
<li>Reword the paragraph in front of Proposition 2.1.4 to be clearer.
<li>Add the value of \(f'(z_0)\) in Proposition 2.1.4 in terms of the
  real partials as we have also proved that above, and it is good to
  emphasize.
<li>Add some segue sentences in subsection 2.2.1, and rename Proposition 2.2.5 
  to "Power rule and its consequences"
<li>Exericse 2.2.2 should just ask for the power rule, the second item is
  asked for in Exercise 2.2.3.
<li>In Exercise 2.2.11, just use the identically equal sign to make it easier
  to read.
<li>Add a note about what Proposition 2.2.9 means in view of Exercise 1.1.7
  after the proof of the proposition.
<li>Proper proof of the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem, it seemed to imply
  divergence about the series of the absolute values.
<li>Add the word "absolutely" to Figure 2.4
<li>Reword Remark 2.3.5.  We do definitely need addition, it is
  multiplication can could plausibly be put off for later.
<li>On page 54 when comparing the definitions of line integrals, fix the
  right hand side and also add an underbrace that shows that the right hand
  side is precisely our previous definition.
<li>After the definition of the line integral, note that the definition still
  holds even if the derivative would be zero.
<li>In Exercise 3.1.5, say \(f\equiv 1\) instead of \(f=1\) for emphasis.
<li>Fix Proposition 3.1.7 to mention that the new path might not be a path if
  we are disallowing zero derivatives.
<li>In the remark after Definition 3.2.5 emphasize "is" and "is equivalent to"
  to make it clear what is the difference that we are talking about.
<li>In proof of 3.2.9 make sure to state that \(\alpha\) is a complex number.
<li>Add Exercise 6.2.10, which is a nice application of Montel to
  characterizing the radius of convergence.
<li>Add Exercise 7.3.11 that requires infinitely many reflections.
<li>Flip the order of proof in Proposition A.2.13 to be more logical.
<li>In Exercise A.3.11, only ask for the part of the proposition that was not
  yet proved to avoid confusing matters.
<li>Theorem A.5.7 should mention that \(X\) ought not be empty.
<li>Clean up the proof of Proposition B.2.1 to not use sequences as it's
  simpler without.
<li>Some minor clarifications and fixes throughout.
<li>Fix the known <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
