<li>Make the caption in Figure 1.5 more correct: The sphere is the normal
  \(S^2\) sphere.
<li>In the example in the last paragraph of 1.3 (page 21), make \(g(z) = c-z\)
  so that the limit ends up being c instead of 0.
<li>Write Proposition 2.2.5 even for \(n=0\) but add the special case
  to the formula then.  Avoids a common question.  Also use \(\frac{d}{dz}\)
  instead of the apostrophe, hopefully that's clearer notation anyway
  and the one we use in 2.2.4.
<li><b>Very slight change to Exercise 2.2.2</b>
  due to the change to Proposition 2.2.5, that is,
  the student should now also say that \(z^0\)
  is holomorphic.
<li>On page 36, add a couple of sentences about why we have the
	modulus squared in the determinant.
<li><b>Add exercise 2.3.12</b> proving uniqueness of the coefficients
  directly without having the more heavyweight formula for the coefficients
  (which comes a couple of pages later) as the uniqueness fact is much simpler
  and a good practice, plus useful in another exercise before we get to the
  formula with the derivatives.
<li>On page 54, don't tell the reader to necessarily use sines and cosines,
  and mark exercise 3.1.1 as easy.
<li>Add assumption that \(g'\) is continuous to Proposition 3.1.7 as we
	haven't yet proved it, and add a footnote about it.
<li>On page 58, note that the caveat about convergence of paths applies
	to both the \(dz\) and the \(|dz|\) integrals.
<li>Move the figure 3.3 up a paragraph which makes for a much nicer
  pagebreak, moves Cauchy-Goursat to next page.
<li>To be consistent with our definition of triangle, in Proposition 3.2.11,
	make a note about when the points are collinear,
	the integral is trivially zero without the hypothesis.
<li>Make title of subsection 3.3.2 a little more precise so that
	someone doesn't get the idea that "Morera" is a property of
	the derivative.
<li>On page 87, add a comment about Schwarz-Pick providing the bound
  at other points than 0.
<li>Clarify the proof of Rado's theorem.
