<li>Add polar form and polar coordinates to the index.
<li>On page 18, improve figure 1.4 to include a shaded horizontal and
  vertical strip in two shades of gray to make it easier to see.
<li>Also on page 18, use \(w\) for the target variable to avoid confusion
  when defining the annulus and the sector.
<li>At end of section 1.3, when discussing arithmetic, note that
  \(z+\infty=\infty\) can be defined, it is just that \(\infty+\infty\)
  and \(\infty-\infty\) are undefined.
<li>In section 1.4, when defining \(T_a\) and \(D_a\) note where \(a\) lives,
  in particular, that for \(D_a,\) the \(a\) should be nonzero.
<li>In section 2.1.1 emphasize a tiny bit more the fact that the \(h\)
  is complex.
<li>In section 2.1.1 explicitly state what \(o(|h|)\) means rather than being
  vague.
<li>Reword the paragraph in front of Proposition 2.1.4 to be clearer.
<li>Add the value of \(f'(z_0)\) in Proposition 2.1.4 in terms of the
  real partials as we have also proved that above, and it is good to
  emphasize.
<li>In the proof of Proposition 2.2.2, don't refer to \(f\) and \(g\)
  being holomorphic, they are simply complex differentiable at one
  point.
<li>Add some segue sentences in subsection 2.2.1, and rename Proposition 2.2.5 
  to "Power rule and its consequences"
<li>Exercise 2.2.2 should just ask for the power rule, the second item is
  asked for in Exercise 2.2.3.
<li>In Exercise 2.2.11, just use the identically equal sign to make it easier
  to read.
<li>Add a note about what Proposition 2.2.9 means in view of Exercise 1.1.7
  after the proof of the proposition.
<li>Proper proof of the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem, it seemed to imply
  divergence about the series of the absolute values.
<li>Add the word "absolutely" to Figure 2.4
<li>Reword Remark 2.3.5.  We do definitely need addition, it is
  multiplication can could plausibly be put off for later.
<li>In the proof of 2.4.6, save the "the series converges" only after we
  proved what it is.
<li>In Exercise 2.4.17 emphasize to only show uniqueness.
<li>On page 54 when comparing the definitions of line integrals, fix the
  right hand side and also add an underbrace that shows that the right hand
  side is precisely our previous definition.  Also write \(gamma(t) = x(t) +
  i\, y(t)\) instead of the notation as a point in the plane.
<li>After the definition of the line integral, note that the definition still
  holds even if the derivative would be zero.
<li>In simple justification of reparametrization, use
  \(h' &gt; 0\) and \(h' &lt; 0\) instead of increasing decreasing
  to avoid zero derivative.
<li>In Exercise 3.1.5, say \(f\equiv 1\) instead of \(f=1\) for emphasis.
<li>Fix Proposition 3.1.7 to mention that the new path might not be a path if
  we are disallowing zero derivatives.
<li>In the remark after Definition 3.2.5 emphasize "is" and "is equivalent to"
  to make it clear what is the difference that we are talking about.
<li>In proof of 3.2.9 make sure to state that \(\alpha\) is a complex number.
<li>In proof of Theorem 3.3.11, no need to handle the case when \(P(z)\) is
  constant, it is nonconstant by definition.
<li>After the proof of 3.3.8, in the example, make it centered at \(p\)
  to fix an erratum and mention again that the sup norm is \(M.\)
<li>In proof A of 3.4.1, mention that we are applying Cauchy--Goursat
  (though it could also be one of the other Cauchy theorems).
<li>Reword Definition 3.4.4 to read more naturally hopefully.
<li>In proof of 3.4.5, one of the equalities was written as an inequality so
  fix that (it was not really wrong).
<li>On page 91, checking that the formula for the principal branch of the
  logarithm works, note that \(L(1)=0=\operatorname{Log}(1)\) to start with.
<li>On page 95, at the end of the proof of Proposition 4.1.2, it says that
  \(L_j\) are branches of \(\log\) but they are branches of \(log (z-p).\)
<li>In Definition 4.2.1, use "open" rather than "domain", connected is not
  needed.
<li>Improve the wording of proof of Theorem 4.2.2, it was misleading in a
  couple of bits.
<li>Emphasize before Proposition 4.3.7 that simply-connectedness is
  a topological concept.
<li>After statement of Theorem 4.4.2 (Laurent series), expand a bit on the
  convergence of such a series using what we know about power series.
<li>In the introduction to subsection 4.5.1, emphasize that by "path"
  in this section we mean continuous.  Also drop the footnote on definition
  4.5.1, I think it was more misleading than helpful.
<li>In Proposition 4.5.6 drop the "piecewise-\(C^1\)" it is not really
  needed any paths will do, though we only really need it for
  piecewise-\(C^1 .\)
<li>Replace the quote at the beginning of chapter 5 with one that irritates
  me less given what's happening in the world.
<li>Shortening/tightening some wording to improve the flow improves also the pagination
  a tiny bit in sections 6.2 and 6.3
<li>Add Exercise 6.2.10, which is a nice application of Montel to
  characterizing the radius of convergence.
<li>Add Exercise 7.3.11 that requires infinitely many reflections.
<li>Flip the order of proof in Proposition A.2.13 to be more logical.
<li>In Exercise A.3.11, only ask for the part of the proposition that was not
  yet proved to avoid confusing matters.
<li>Theorem A.5.7 should mention that \(X\) ought not be empty.
<li>A little bit of cleanup of the proof of Theorem B.3.16.
<li>Clean up the proof of Proposition B.2.1 to not use sequences as it's
  simpler without.
<li>Some minor clarifications and fixes throughout.
<li>Fix the known <a href="errata.html">errata</a>.
