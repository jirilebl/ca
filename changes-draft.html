<li>Consistently use
"converges uniformly on compact subsets" instead of sometimes
"converges uniformly on compact sets."
<li>In proof of Riemann mapping, at the end refer back to the construction of
  the \(h\) to make it clear why the maximizer must be onto.
<li>Add Exercise 6.3.9 (entire and injective implies onto)
<li>Change the proof of 7.1.10 (Identity) to be more consistent with
  7.1.11 (Maximum principle).
