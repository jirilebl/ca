The main focus of this version is to fix errata identified by AI,
which seems quite capable nowadays, although I would suggest
not using it blindly on texts like these, it is often incorrect too.


<li>In the proof of Proposition 3.5.3, use \(b\) instead of \(a\) in the proof,
  as it is not quite the \(a\) from the statement.
<li>In the proof of Theorem 3.2.9, we handle the case when \(g(z_0)\not=0,\)
  but that never happens by definition of \(g,\) so just remove that
  sentence.
<li>In <b>Exercise 3.2.20</b> it now correctly says \(d\bar{z} = dx - i \, dy
  .\)
<li>In <b>Exercise 3.4.10</b>, the <i>exponential order</i> definition in the
  exercise now correctly says \(|f(t)| \leq M e^{ct} ,\) though that
  changes the exercise (to what was intended originally obviously).
<li>Rewrite the proof of Lemma 4.7.2 to hopefully be clearer.
<li>In the proof of Theorem 4.7.3, make the lines be horizontal to avoid
  a rotation midway through the argument.  Modify Figure 4.10
  to match this new setup.  It is true it makes the first part
  a little weird as it's not the graph \(y=f(x)\) but \(x=f(y)\) now,
  but I think it is now clearer and matches the picture in all parts
  of the proof.
<li>Be more careful with the parenthetical remark about simple pole in
  Proposition 5.3.5, \(f\) only has a simple pole at \(p\) if
  \(h(p) \not=0 ,\)  so just say "at most a simple pole at \(p\)".
<li>In <b>Exercise 6.1.2</b>, the functions in the sequence are now
  assumed to be bounded, otherwise one would only get the result for
  a tail of the sequence.
<li><b>Replace the faulty Exercise 6.2.8</b> with a different one.
<li>In <b>Exercise 6.3.2 part c</b>, the definition of the upper half disc
  is now fixed.
<li>In the proof of Theorem 7.3.2, make the argument about \(-c_1 \geq 0\)
  a tiny bit clearer.
<li>In the proof of Theorem 7.4.3, emphasize that \(f= \varphi+h \)
  when using it in the long estimate.
<li>Fix the erratum in the proof of Proposition 8.1.3
  by replacing the proof by a simpler one.  Also put the note
  about the sum of Logs into the proof as we need it there.
<li>Add a short note before Corollary 8.1.9
  about the change in notation from \(\prod (1+g_n(x))\)
  to \(\prod f_n(x)\) and what it means in terms of the definitions.
<li>In section 9.4, try to use letters as indices only for
  specific purpose, to make things clearer.
  In particular, use \(m\) for the index in the expression
  \(P_p,\) in the statement of the theorem, and use 
  \(p\) for the point in Example 9.4.2
  and in the statement of Exercise 9.4.1.
<li>Add Example 9.4.3 with the example from Exercise 9.4.2, showing that the
  \(R_n\) really are necessary in general.
<li>Add a note after proof of the Monodromy theorem on page 229
  about all paths fixed-endpoint homotopic in a simply
  connected domain, and add an exercise (10.2.17)
  to prove the converse (actually prove existence of primitives)
  as it is a nice quick application of
  continuation.
