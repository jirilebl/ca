<li>Make the caption in Figure 1.5 more correct: The sphere is the normal
  \(S^2\) sphere.
<li>In the example in the last paragraph of 1.3 (page 21), make \(g(z) = c-z\)
  so that the limit ends up being c instead of 0.
<li>Write Proposition 2.2.5 even for \(n=0\) but add the special case
  to the formula then.  Avoids a common question.  Also use \(\frac{d}{dz}\)
  instead of the apostrophe, hopefully that's clearer notation anyway
  and the one we use in 2.2.4.
<li><b>Very slight change to Exercise 2.2.2</b>
  due to the change to Proposition 2.2.5, that is,
  the student should now also say that \(z^0\)
  is holomorphic.
<li>On page 36, add a couple of sentences about why we have the
	modulus squared in the determinant.
<li>Clarify the proof of Rado's theorem.
