<li>On page 54 when comparing the definitions of line integrals, fix the
  right hand side and also add an underbrace that shows that the right hand
  side is precisely our previous definition.
<li>After the definition of the line integral, note that the definition still
  holds even if the derivative would be zero.
<li>Fix Proposition 3.1.7 to mention that the new path might not be a path if
  we are disallowing zero derivatives.
<li>Add Exercise 6.2.10, which is a nice application of Montel to
  characterizing the radius of convergence.
<li>Add Exercise 7.3.11 that requires infinitely many reflections.
