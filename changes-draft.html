<li>In the proof of Proposition 3.1.8, mark which integral is the arclength
  integral of the modulus.
<li>In the intro to 3.3.2, the example of real differentiable function would
  only work for bounded \(g\) so integrate from some \(c \in (a,b).\)
<li>In proof of Theorem 3.3.6, maximum modulus principle, consider a closed
  disc in \(U\) rather than just saying a circle, it is clearer this way, we
  are talking about \(|z| \leq r\) anyhow here.
<li>Change the wording of 3.3.10 to be more precise.
<li>Improve the wording of proof of 3.3.11 a bit more.
<li>In the proof of Schwarz's lemma, talk about maximum modulus getting the
  bound \(|g(z)| \leq \frac{1}{r}\) instead of \(r|f(z)| \leq |z| .\)  Then
  only once we show that \(|g(z)| \leq 1\) go to \(r|f(z)| \leq |z| .\) 
  Seems more straightforward stated this way.
<li>Note that Exercise 3.5.3 is called the Cartan's uniqueness theorem
  and add it to the index.
<li>In proof of Corollary 5.2.3, emphasize where proof of first item ends and
  the proof of the converse statement starts.
<li>In the comments after Definition 5.2.4, emphasize that
  \(\ell \in \mathbb{Z} .\)
<li>Simplify statement of Hurwitz a tiny bit.
<li>Add some more hyperlinks.
