<li>Make the caption in Figure 1.5 more correct: The sphere is the normal
  \(S^2\) sphere.
<li>In the example in the last paragraph of 1.3 (page 21), make \(g(z) = c-z\)
  so that the limit ends up being c instead of 0.
<li>Write Proposition 2.2.5 even for \(n=0\) but add the special case
  to the formula then.  Avoids a common question.  Also use \(\frac{d}{dz}\)
  instead of the apostrophe, hopefully that's clearer notation anyway
  and the one we use in 2.2.4.
<li><b>Very slight change to Exercise 2.2.2</b>
  due to the change to Proposition 2.2.5, that is,
  the student should now also say that \(z^0\)
  is holomorphic.
<li>On page 36, add a couple of sentences about why we have the
	modulus squared in the determinant.
<li><b>Add Exercise 2.3.12</b> proving uniqueness of the coefficients
  directly without having the more heavyweight formula for the coefficients
  (which comes a couple of pages later) as the uniqueness fact is much simpler
  and a good practice, plus useful in another exercise before we get to the
  formula with the derivatives.
<li>On page 54, don't tell the reader to necessarily use sines and cosines,
  and mark Exercise 3.1.1 as easy.
<li>Add assumption that \(g'\) is continuous to Proposition 3.1.7 as we
	haven't yet proved it, and add a footnote about it.
<li>On page 58, note that the caveat about convergence of paths applies
	to both the \(dz\) and the \(|dz|\) integrals.
<li>Move the figure 3.3 up a paragraph which makes for a much nicer
  page break, moves Cauchy-Goursat to next page.
<li>To be consistent with our definition of triangle, in Proposition 3.2.11,
	make a note about when the points are collinear,
	the integral is trivially zero without the hypothesis.
<li><b>Slight change to Exercise 3.2.19:</b> Assume
  that \(U_1 \cap U_2\) is nonempty, that's a technicality that makes for
  a very slightly harder-to-state solution, but that's not the main thing.
  Plus most students miss this technicality.
<li>Make title of subsection 3.3.2 a little more precise so that
	someone doesn't get the idea that "Morera" is a property of
	the derivative.
<li>Add a few remarks to the proof of 3.4.5, first in the beginning mention
	that \(f_n \to f\) uniformly on the circle, second
	at the end, note explicitly the key fact that the \(d/2\) circle is a subset of \(K' .\)
<li>On page 87, add a comment about Schwarz-Pick providing the bound
  at other points than 0.
<li>After 4.2.2, note that the proof is rather recent and due to Dixon.
	Also be a little bit more explicit on what this entire function is
	in the paragraph after the theorem.
<li>In the paragraph after Proposition 4.3.6, do not refer to the argument
  principle section as Exercise 5.4.7 now does not actually fully prove (it
  was actually quite difficult and didn't really use the argument principle
  theorem itself) the equivalence of existence of roots and simply connectedness.
<li>Use an enumerate in Proposition 4.4.3 for the two parts.  As a side
	benefit it is clear that there is a second part that happens to
	be on the next page.
<li>Make the hint in Exercise 4.4.1 be more useful; pointing the
	student at subsection 3.4.2 is a better hint.
<li>Add footnote to Definition 4.5.9 to note that this is the actual
	definition of homotopy for any path connected topological space.
<li><b>Reword Exercise 5.1.7</b> to say that we should prove that the
limit of the quotient always exists (if allowed to equal infinity).  
It is asking for a little bit more, but not
only is that a better way to state the exercise,
it also makes it simpler to do and less confusing.
<li>In Example 5.3.6, use all three propositions for computing the residue.
<li><b>Reword Exercise 5.4.7</b> to make it clear what to prove, and word it
  so that the existence of a \(\gamma\) with winding number 1 around p is
  given (as that is hard to prove at this point, too hard for an exercise,
  and this one is designed to test something different).
<li><b>Add Exercise 6.3.16</b> that is at the right place to prove the
  existence of that cycle that was needed in 5.4.7.  Part b would be easy
  to prove if the student got 5.4.7, but that's OK.
<li>Add Remark 6.3.4 about existence of square roots being equivalent to
  the domain being simply connected as that's an immediate consequence of
  the proof.
<li>Clarify the proof of Rado's theorem.
