<li>In the proof of Proposition 3.5.3, use b instead of a in the proof,
  as it is not quite the a from the statement.
<li>In the proof of Theorem 4.7.3, make the lines be horizontal to avoid
  a rotation midway through the argument.  Modify Figure 4.10
  to match this new setup.  It is true it makes the first part
  a little weird as it's not the graph $y=f(x)$ but $x=f(y)$ now, but I think
  it is now clearer and matches the picture in all parts of the proof.
