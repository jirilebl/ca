<li>In the proof of Proposition 3.1.8, mark which integral is the arclength
  integral of the modulus.
<li>In proof of Theorem 3.3.6, maximum modulus principle, consider a closed
  disc in \(U\) rather than just saying a circle, it is clearer this way, we
  are talking about \(|z| \leq r\) anyhow here.
<li>Improve the wording of proof of 3.3.11 a bit more.
