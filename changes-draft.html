The main point of this revision was to go through the exercises and shake out
as many typos as possible especially the exercises that weren't assigned in
my class.

<li>In the proof of Proposition 3.1.8, mark which integral is the arclength
  integral of the modulus.
<li>In Exercise 3.1.13 be more explicit either the path is injective or it is
  simple closed.  The way it was stated made it seem like plausibly one that
  just bites itself somewhere is also allowed, which was not intended.
<li>In the intro to 3.3.2, the example of real differentiable function would
  only work for bounded \(g\) so integrate from some \(c \in (a,b).\)
<li>In proof of Theorem 3.3.6, maximum modulus principle, consider a closed
  disc in \(U\) rather than just saying a circle, it is clearer this way, we
  are talking about \(|z| \leq r\) anyhow here.
<li>Streamline the wording of Exercise 3.3.19 a bit and include the
  definition of \(\limsup_{z \to \infty} .\)
<li>Change the wording of Theorem 3.3.10 (Liouville) to be more precise.
<li>Improve the wording of proof of Theorem 3.3.11 (FTA) a bit more.
<li>In the proof of Schwarz's lemma, talk about maximum modulus getting the
  bound \(|g(z)| \leq \frac{1}{r}\) instead of \(r|f(z)| \leq |z| .\)  Then
  only once we show that \(|g(z)| \leq 1\) go to \(r|f(z)| \leq |z| .\) 
  Seems more straightforward stated this way.
<li>Note that Exercise 3.5.3 is called the Cartan's uniqueness theorem
  and add it to the index.
<li>In exercise 3.5.7, ask for the condition \(ad-bc &gt; 0\) rather than
  just \(ad-bc \not= 0 ,\) as while "correct" it is misleading.
<li>In proof of Corollary 5.2.3, emphasize where proof of first item ends and
  the proof of the converse statement starts.
<li>In the comments after Definition 5.2.4, emphasize that
  \(\ell \in \mathbb{Z} .\)
<li>Reword Exercise 5.2.23 to be a bit more readable.
<li>Reword Exercise 5.4.6 to make it explicit as to what the power sums are.
<li>Reword proof of Exercise 5.4.7, it is a bit misleading.
<li>Simplify statement of Hurwitz a tiny bit.
<li>In Exercise 6.2.2, emphasize that \(U \subset {\mathbb{C}},\) as the two
  notions are not the same in an arbitrary metric space.
<li>Reword part a) of 6.2.6 to be more explicit.
<li>Add some more hyperlinks.
