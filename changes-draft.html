<li>change ``up to multiplicity'' to ``counting multiplicity''.  We were
  using both so stick to one, and the second one is clearer.
<li>In the proof of Proposition B.3.13, use j,k for the same thing
	as in the definition B.3.12 and Proposition B.3.11
	for consistency.  This required changing k to h',
	which is more consistent with the naming of A' anyway.
	Also use p for the fixed point rather than x for
	consistency.
