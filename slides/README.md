Slides for a YouTube course
===========================

These are slides for a youtube course, but the idea is that these could also be
just taken and used in other classes.  They will be slightly updated and
improved even after the youtube videos are done, so they may be slightly
different than what appeared in the youtube course.  The copyright license is
the same as the book, so feel free to use these in your classes and modify them
in the same way as the book itself.

The aspect ratio 16:9 is by default set to make it work better with youtube or
online streaming to take advantage of the whole screen.  Perhaps for
traditional projectors it might be good to change this back to 4:3,
but perhaps you might have to modify some of the slides if you do that.

The figures are imported from a subdirectory ../figures/ relative to the
current directory, so if you want to build these in a different directory
structure, make sure to copy the relevant figures and adapt the subimport
and includegraphics commands.

This is a longer term project so it will probably take a while for this to be
completely filled in.
