An introductory course in complex analysis for incoming graduate students. Created to teach Math 5283 at Oklahoma State University. The book has somewhat more material than could fit in a one-semester course, allowing some choices. There are also appendices on metric spaces and some basic analysis background to make for a longer and more complete course for those that have only had an introduction to basic analysis on the real line.
