Things not marked with FIXMEs in the file (not sure where to stick them yet):

* Schottky's theorem (equivalence of annuli) should go somewhere, perhaps as exercise, but need the machinery

* add any stuff to the notation glossary that is missing

* open sets / domains empty/nonempty a problem somewhere ... check some more

* check if we are using "constant path" or some such somewhere (check some
  more that is)

* "piecewise C^1 cycle" "piecewise C^1 chain"?  Probably not, it's getting
  to "verbiagy" and we don't have any other types of chains.  We already
  probably overdo it with the "piecewise C^1 path" stuff.
