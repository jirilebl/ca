Things definitely for the next big version

* Riemann surfaces

* Blaschke products

* Schottky's theorem (equivalence of annuli) should go somewhere, perhaps as exercise, but need the machinery

* Inhomogeneous dbar solution (See Hormander) using Mittag-Leffler.

* Hopf lemma (in a disc)

Possibilities

* Proof of our version of Green's in an appendix
