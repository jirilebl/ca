Things not marked with FIXMEs in the file (not sure where to stick them yet):

* Schottky's theorem (equivalence of annuli) should go somewhere, perhaps as exercise, but need the machinery

* add any stuff to the notation glossary that is missing

* open sets / domains empty/nonempty a problem somewhere ... check some more

* check if we are using "constant path" or some such somewhere (check some
  more that is)
