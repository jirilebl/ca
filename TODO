More minor things to do/think about in the next version:

* Mark important exercises, once that are used, or once that are important
  for the exposition, rather than just being exercises to try.

* Perhaps add proposition about Laurent series convergence in 4.4 (that is,
  it converges on compact subsets of the annulus) we only say this in text
  right now.

* Change Proposition 6.1.4 to be about a set of functions rather than a
  sequence?  Note that all the other propositions/theorems are stated for
  sequences.  Except in the Montel section where we switch to sets of
  functions.  Perhaps we should move the whole 6.1 section also to sets where
  possible.

Things definitely for the next big version

* Riemann surfaces

* Blaschke products

* Schottky's theorem (equivalence of annuli) should go somewhere, perhaps as exercise, but need the machinery

* Inhomogeneous dbar solution (See Hormander) using Mittag-Leffler.

* Hopf lemma (in a disc)

Possibilities

* Proof of our version of Green's in an appendix
