Things to possibly still do.

* Mark important exercises, once that are used, or once that are important
  for the exposition, rather than just being exercises to try.

Things definitely for the next big version

* Riemann surfaces

* Blaschke products

* Schottky's theorem (equivalence of annuli) should go somewhere, perhaps as exercise, but need the machinery

* Inhomogeneous dbar solution (See Hormander) using Mittag-Leffler.

* Hopf lemma (in a disc)

Possibilities

* Proof of our version of Green's in an appendix
